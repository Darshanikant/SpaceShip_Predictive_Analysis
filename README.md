# SpaceShip_Predictive_Analysis
SpaceShip Predictive Analysis is a machine learning project that predicts whether passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension after a collision. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.



# SpaceShip Predictive Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a **predictive analysis project** focused on determining whether passengers aboard the **Spaceship Titanic** were transported to an alternate dimension after a collision with a spacetime anomaly. The dataset, provided as part of a Kaggle competition, includes personal and travel-related details of the passengers.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding dataset distribution, feature correlations, and missing values
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and outlier treatment
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting insights from categorical variables like Cabin, HomePlanet, and CryoSleep
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy

## Dataset Details
The dataset consists of 14 attributes, including:
- **Passenger Information:** PassengerID, Age, VIP status, HomePlanet
- **Travel Details:** Cabin, Destination, CryoSleep status
- **Spending Patterns:** RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck
- **Target Variable:** Transported (whether the passenger was transported to another dimension)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Handling Missing Values & Data Cleaning**
3. **Feature Engineering & Transformation**
4. **Model Selection & Training**
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning & Evaluation**
6. **Prediction & Conclusion**

## Results & Key Findings
- Data preprocessing significantly improved model performance
- Feature engineering enhanced accuracy and model interpretability
- Ensemble models like **Random Forest & Gradient Boosting** outperformed basic classifiers

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
